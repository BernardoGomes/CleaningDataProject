<br>The Project is to get data from the following file: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip, 
<br>clean them and make a tidy data.frame with the average of each measurement, for each subject and each activity. 
<br>
<br>The activities are the following:
<br>  activity.id activity.description
<br>           1              WALKING
<br>           2     WALKING_UPSTAIRS
<br>           3   WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
<br>           4              SITTING
<br>           5             STANDING
<br>           6               LAYING
<br>
<br>The subjects are numbered from 1 to 30.
<br><br>The output of the script is a txt file, with the calculated average of every std and mean variables, for each subject id and activity. 
<br>These are the variables in the tidy.data.txt file:
